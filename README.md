## Code

The code folder contains Jupyter notebooks that utilize a Python kernel to visualize and analyze the data.

`TAS_plot.ipynb`: plots the total alkali vs silica composition of samples

`composite_pystrat.ipynb`: generates the composite stratigraphic column thicknesses

`date_bar_plots.ipynb`: makes the date bar plots of CA-ID-TIMS U-Pb dates

`detrital_zircon_analysis.ipynb`: conducts statistical analyses and generates visualizations of detrital zircon data from this study and others that are integrated for comparison

## Data

### LA_ICP_MS

Contains `TableS1_LA-ICP-MS_Gerasimov_21Nov2022.xlsx` data table of LA-ICP-MS U-Pb results.

### geochemistry

Contains XRF data.

### pystrat
